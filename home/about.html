					<h4><span>the dream in my heart</span></h4>
					<p>
						I always have a dream, that is to do the things you want to do. I want to live in their own want to live in the world, to create their own want to create something.
And on the University, I always want to learn what they want to learn in the University, I hope my university is a fully controlled by my university, rather than being around other people's university. So I won't consider to grind or security research, also do not want to find their own what the right job. I always want to venture himself in university period, or after the university graduates to start their own business. Although many people are close to say I was too naive or too extreme, but I think that only not to move or retreat to go its own way, was finally able to DOSOMETHINPREVIOUSLYUNRELEASED. I will keep.
Do you want to join me?
